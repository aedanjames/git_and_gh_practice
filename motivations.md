I am intrinsically motivated to learn more in pursuit of knowledge. I enjoy learning, and feel fulfilled when I can master a new task. I felt I had plateaued in my career as a surgical tech, and I find myself more dissatisfied every day that I spend in that career. Since giving notice and choosing to attend Turing, I have only become more sure that I'm doing the best thing for myself and my happiness.
