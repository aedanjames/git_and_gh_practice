My absolute favorite hobby is Muay Thai, the art of eight limbs.
I also enjoy playing videogames. Mostly single player role-playing or adventure games.
I suppose training my dog could qualify as a hobby, but it's also a necessity.
I hope to learn how to work on my old 1998 Jeep Wrangler after completing the program at Turing.
